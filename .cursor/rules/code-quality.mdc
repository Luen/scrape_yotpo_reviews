# Code Quality Standards

## Principles

- **Clean Code**: Write code that is easy to read, understand, and maintain
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Avoid code duplication. Extract common functionality into reusable functions, modules, or utilities
- **Maintainability**: Code should be easy to modify and extend without breaking existing functionality
- **Quality First**: Prioritize code quality over speed. Well-written code saves time in the long run

## Guidelines

### Code Organization
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and modules
- Group related functionality together
- Follow consistent patterns and conventions

### Avoiding Duplication
- Extract repeated code blocks into functions
- Create utility modules for common operations
- Use configuration objects for similar patterns
- Consider creating helper functions for repeated logic

### Error Handling
- Always handle errors gracefully
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Use try-catch blocks appropriately
- Log errors for debugging purposes

### Documentation
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep README and documentation up to date
- Use JSDoc comments for function documentation when appropriate
