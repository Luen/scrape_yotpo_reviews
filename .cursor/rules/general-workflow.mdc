# Development Workflow

## Code Changes Workflow

When making any code changes, follow this process:

1. **Make Changes**: Write clean, DRY, maintainable code
2. **Run Lint**: Always run `npm run lint:fix` after changes
3. **Update Version**: If changes warrant a release, bump version in `package.json`
4. **Commit**: Include version bump in commit message if applicable
5. **Push**: Push to trigger GitHub Actions release (if version changed)

## Key Principles

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Extract repeated code into reusable functions
- Create utility modules for common operations
- Avoid copy-pasting code blocks

### Code Quality
- Write readable, well-structured code
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Follow project coding standards
- Keep functions small and focused

### Testing
- Test your changes before committing
- Verify functionality works as expected
- Check for edge cases

## Quick Reference Commands

```bash
# Lint code
npm run lint

# Auto-fix linting issues
npm run lint:fix

# Run example
npm run example
```

## Commit Message Guidelines

When committing code with version changes:
- Include version number in commit message
- Example: "Add pagination improvements - Bump version to 0.0.4"
- Example: "Fix review extraction bug - Bump version to 0.0.3"
